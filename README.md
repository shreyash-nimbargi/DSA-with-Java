# 📚 DSA with Java

# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java 🚀

This repository is where I document and practice DSA using Java — everything from basic concepts to advanced problems. I'm building this as part of my placement and interview prep.

It's my learning journal — where I code, debug, learn, and grow.
